It came to my attention that people wanted to test several
of my boot sector games over real PC XT machines.

Unfortunately, nasm doesn't run over 8086/8088 processors,
and I couldn't find a compatible assembler, so what does a
programmer when doesn't find the required tool? Start to
code his own tool!

Using the same command line syntax as nasm:

  tinyasm -f bin rogue.asm -o rogue.img


>> BUILDING THE ASSEMBLER >>

You can build your own executable for tinyasm using the
C compiler Desmet C, version 3.1h available graciously at:

    http://www.desmet-c.com/

It has many bugs and limitations, but it works for tinyasm
purposes, and it's freely available.

I provide an executable on the Git to save you some time.
